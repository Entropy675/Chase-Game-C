Description: 

This code implements a game of chase. It creates runners, such as a Timmy, Harold, Dorcs, and Ninjas, which move around on a the Vale.
Each character has their own movement behavoir.
Uses multithreading for display vs logic, uses a semaphore (as a mutex) to protect game data.
The code runs until one of the heros (Timmy/Harold) reaches the other side of the Vale, or if both of them die. 
The heros die if an enemy occupies the same square as them.
The game then tells you the result of the simulation.

- Walk: [Enemy: takes a diagonal only step towards the nearist player] [Player: take a single step towards the ending line]
- Jump: [Enemy: takes multiple left or up (up to 7) steps towards player] [Player: take multiple steps (up to 7) towards the ending line]
- Slide: [Anyone: Move back (left) up to 4 steps.]
- Sleep: [Anyone: Do nothing.]
- Teleport: [Anyone: Teleports to a random location in the game]
